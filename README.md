# Data-Visualisation-with-Plotly---Independent-Project

## Problem Statement<br />
In this project, you are a data journalist for a renowned publication. Your editor in chief has given
you access to a database that addresses a range of topics. You will be writing a 500 to
800-word article about the topic of your choosing.<br />
Your editor will curate the best articles from your cohort of data journalists and publish them.<br />

You will be solving for one of the following questions:<br />
● What is a high-level diagnosis of the sector you’re studying?<br />
● What are the key facts people need to know about this sector?<br />
● What are key trends that are worth noting? You are welcome to do a little research to
correlate these with trends with events or facts about the sector as long as you remain
objective.<br />
● What recommendations would you have for the sector in question? These need to be
based on the database.<br />

## Methodology<br />
###### 1. Define the question you want to answer<br />
###### 2. Obtain a Data<br />
###### 3. Prepare the Data<br />
      a. Get acquainted with all the columns on your data set.<br />
      b. Pay close attention to the units of measure used.<br />
      c. Imagine how these metrics would work together to help you make your business
      recommendation.<br />
###### 4. Analyze the Data<br />
###### 5. Create a visualization using Plotly<br />
      a. Use whichever graphs you think will be the most prudent in visualizing the
      answers to the project’s questions.<br />
      b. Label the axes and data points sparingly and correctly.<br />
      c. Upload the visualization to Chart Studio.<br />
###### 6. Report the Data<br />
      a. In a 500 to 800 words article, answer the research question.<br />
      b. Upload the article to Medium and include all relevant visualizations in your article
      (at least 3).<br />
      c. Your article needs to be a balanced and objective account, with insights mostly
      coming from your datasets.<br />
